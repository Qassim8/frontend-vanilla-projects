# DOM Playground (Vanilla JavaScript)

A simple **DOM Playground** built with **Vanilla JavaScript** to practice and demonstrate core front-end concepts such as **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **UI state changes** without using any frameworks.
This project focuses on understanding how user interactions affect the DOM and how JavaScript manages UI behavior under the hood.
