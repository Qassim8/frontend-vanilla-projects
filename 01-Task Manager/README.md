<!-- # 🧠 Task Manager (Vanilla JavaScript)

A lightweight **Task Manager** built with **Vanilla JavaScript** to demonstrate solid understanding of **DOM manipulation**, **state management**, and **event delegation** — without using any framework.

This project intentionally mimics how modern frameworks (like React) handle state and rendering, but implemented using plain JavaScript.
